-You can find folders by "walking" thourgh directories
 *"starting point", e.g., 'C:\\Users\\'
 *find match "if folder in root", where folder is a variable(string) name
 *code: for root, dirs, files in os.walk('C:\\Users\\'):
     
     if folder in root:      
     
         print(root, " ", end=" FOUND! ")

-object oriented gazedata reading and processing
*class defined in my_classes.py
*gazedataOO_0.2.py uses the GazeReader from my_classes

 
24.5.2017
-I created a new GitHub repository for Python gazedata analyses
*it can be "cloned" to laptop local folder on Git commandline by:
 git clone git://github.com/yrttiahoS/py_gazedat
 **saves to: C:\Users\infant\Documents\GitHub\py_gazedat
 **command has repository's URL, but string "https" is omitted
 **see also: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/651038/how-do-you-clone-a-git-repository-into-a-specific-folder
 
-headers used in different gazedata formats are listen in: headers_in_sites.xlxs
*headers for mi? 
 	try finding with check_headers.py
 
26.5.2017
-check_headers.py now works
*I analyxe mi headers

-I made object oriented style header cheking and expanded my_classes with
 class DataFolder



29.5.2017
-explain headers in:
C:\Users\Public\Documents\Tampereen yliopisto\Eye tracker\Aaltonen17\headers_in_sites.xlsx
*tobii-pro-studio-user-manual.pdf, p: 144


-find data values with: check_dataOO_0.1.py

30.5.2017
-I expanded my_classes and routine
-I made a working version of check_dataOO_0.1.py

-Include -1.#QNAN and 1.#QNAN to "null values"


21.6.2017
-check_dataOO_0.1.py and DataFolder.write_stats_to_file() still output too 
 many values as statistics (should be min,max or list of strings)
*it interprets numerical values as strings and thus "cannot" extract min,max
*-1.#QNAN and 1.#QNAN were not included in "null value" list, 
  try running script now with this improvement, does work:?	

#about_68
Disengagement273-320-289-1.gazedata, has strings in 
	XGazePosRightEye
	Reason: last datacolumn ID=61353, 
		is incomplete and has "-" instead of numerical value for this col
	Solutions:
		a) read/convert "-" to null
		b) don't read incomplete data rows, in myclasses.GazeReader
		try: #try to accces data element    
                        foo = row[ncol]    
                    except(IndexError): #if index oob, use element of previuous row    
                        break #break out from incomplete row

Disengagement-223-1.gazedata, has strings in 
	DistanceRightEye
	Reason: last datacolumn ID=61353, 
		is incomplete and has "-" instead of numerical value for this col

-I chose to include "-" in the list of "null" values
-for extractinf gazedata min,max and string lists for all headers,
	the code should now work for treC2data!
	*run next time, with check_dataOO_0.1 
-save all to gitcloud
